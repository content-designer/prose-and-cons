			 <p>I built something I needed: a UX writing agent for Claude that reviews interface copy directly from Figma.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what it does — you drop in a Figma frame link, and Claude uses the skill to audit your copy against UX writing best practices. Error messages that lack actionability. CTAs that don&rsquo;t set clear expectations. Microcopy that creates cognitive load instead of reducing it.</p>
<p>This matters because we&rsquo;re at an inflection point. AI tools are everywhere, but most content designers are still operating like it&rsquo;s 2019 — manually reviewing every screen, writing similar strings over and over, burning cycles on work that should be systematized.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m releasing this as open source because I think our discipline needs to own how AI changes our work. Not defensively, not by pretending LLMs will replace judgment, but by building the tools that let us operate at a different level — less time on mechanical review, more time on strategic problems that require human expertise.</p>
<p>The technical foundation is Claude&rsquo;s MCP + skills system. The content framework draws from years of practiced critique and established UX writing principles. The result is something that catches 80% of the obvious issues so you can focus on the 20% that actually requires your expertise.</p>
<p>If you work in content design, UX writing, or any adjacent discipline, the code is on GitHub. Contributions welcome — this gets better the more experienced practitioners feed into it.</p>

<p>This is how I think content design evolves: not by resisting AI, but by building systems that amplify human judgment instead of replacing it.</p>
<p>Agree?</p>

			 <p>We’ve all been told robots will take our jobs. What if they taught us how to resist instead?</p>
<p>The four robots in Annalee Newitz’s novella, Automatic Noodle (Aug 5, 2025), Staybehind, Sweetie, Cayenne, and Hands, do just that. This book has a big appetite despite its slim proportions. It confronts immigration, algorithmic prejudice, misinformation, and debt slavery. While it can’t fully explore all these themes, what emerges is a compelling model of communal resistance, exemplified by a robot-run, hand-pulled noodle shop in near-future San Francisco, where California has seceded from America after a brutal civil war.</p>
<p>In 2064, four abandoned HEEI (human equivalent embodied intelligence) robots wake in a flooded San Francisco ghost kitchen. Their owners have fled to America to escape fraud charges. Though technically citizens in post-war California, HEEI can&rsquo;t own property or vote—leaving them vulnerable to being shut down and sold for parts. To survive, they hack city infrastructure and sentient blockchain contracts to open a noodle restaurant. Their success draws a coordinated review-bombing campaign from American operatives targeting California&rsquo;s HEEI businesses.</p>
<p>Unlike the healing fiction trend from Japan and South Korea where bookshops and tea houses are safe havens, the cozy noodle shop in Automatic Noodle is under constant threat. The HEEI fight daily against systemic issues. Their hope is earned, not given.</p>
<p>Staybehind (military strategist), Sweetie (contract specialist), Cayenne (business operations), and Hands (noodle chef) unite to combat prejudice, using their specialized skills to stave off annihilation. The name of their restaurant, Automatic Noodle, started as a slur, but they decide to own it, making it part of their brand. When coordinated negative reviews tank their food delivery app ranking, they go old school, building an antique HTML website to sell their noodles instead.</p>
<p>The novella joins a growing movement in science fiction that rejects apathy and cynicism in favour of stories that embrace hope, community, and kindness in the face of adversity. It’s called hopepunk, as in the opposite of grimdark. Think Monk &amp; Robot by Becky Chambers and The Murderbot Diaries by Martha Wells.</p>
<p>Automatic Noodle is billed as a &ldquo;cozy near-future novella about a crew of leftover robots opening their very own noodle shop.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s more than escapist fiction: it&rsquo;s a battle cry disguised as comfort food. While it bites off more than it can chew and gives some themes surface treatment, it shows that resistance isn&rsquo;t always about violence—sometimes, it&rsquo;s about fighting for the right to make the perfect bowl of hand-pulled noodles and share them with friends.</p>

			 <p>Take a photo. Shake your phone. A haiku “develops” on a Polaroid-style frame. Built in Gizmo as a quick AI × writing experiment.</p>
<p><strong>What it is</strong>
Haiku camera is a tiny tool that turns photos into Polaroids with a poem on the border. It’s playful, fast, and a little nostalgic.</p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Snap a photo in the app.</li>
<li>Shake your phone to “develop” the film.</li>
<li>A haiku appears on the frame, tuned to the image’s vibe.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why I’m building things like this</strong>
I’m exploring the edge where AI meets writing. Small, shippable prototypes help me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test how language feels when it’s generated in context.</li>
<li>Find constraints that lead to better voice and tone.</li>
<li>Turn abstract ideas about “AI and words” into hands-on experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Design constraints I used</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The poem must be a haiku (5–7–5). Constraint breeds style.</li>
<li>The language stays simple, concrete, and human.</li>
<li>The “shake to develop” gesture gates the reveal—play drives delight.</li>
<li>No instructions on the first screen. The product explains itself.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I learned</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Physical gestures add meaning. The shake creates a beat; the poem lands stronger after a pause.</li>
<li>Short form invites care. When you only get 17 syllables, every word earns its spot.</li>
<li>Voice depends on context. The same model feels more “human” when tied to a clear frame and ritual.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this matters for AI + writing</strong>
Most AI features are utilities. That’s fine. But the best product writing also carries emotion and timing. Pairing generation with a clear constraint (haiku) and a tiny ritual (shake) makes the output feel authored instead of dumped.</p>
<p><strong>What’s next</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add a few themed “film stocks” that shape tone (gentle, wry, punchy).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Try it</strong>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>You haven&rsquo;t read a book like The Buffalo Hunter Hunter before. This captivating, disturbing blend of vampire mythology and Indigenous history offers something new to the horror genre. Released on March 18, 2025, this nested narrative holds a dark and cracked mirror to America&rsquo;s genocidal past.</p>
<p>The story begins when Etsy Beaucarne, a junior professor desperate to get published and secure tenure, discovers the journal of her great-great-great-grandfather, Arthur, a Lutheran pastor in early 1900s Montana. Through his ornate Victorian prose—equal parts charming and suspect—we encounter Good Stab, a Blackfeet man whose weekly &ldquo;confessions&rdquo; make up the bloody third frame in Jones&rsquo;s triptych.</p>
<p>Good Stab&rsquo;s confessions unfold against the backdrop of the American West and the atrocities against Indigenous peoples, specifically the Marias Massacre—where approximately 200 women, children, and elderly men were killed in their sleep by the U.S. Army.</p>
<p>When Good Stab encounters American soldiers transporting a mysterious &ldquo;Cat Man,&rdquo; the chaos of battle leaves him bitten and transformed. He becomes what Arthur, reverting to his native German, calls the Nachzehrer—a vampire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I am is the Indian who can&rsquo;t die,&rdquo; says Good Stab. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the worst dream America ever had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good Stab&rsquo;s vengeance against white settlers becomes Jones&rsquo;s most challenging narrative gambit. The relentless bloodshed of the middle section tests our endurance. The violence is deliberately excessive, forcing us to confront the scale of historical atrocities: the Marias Massacre, the decimation of Indigenous populations, the extinction of the buffalo. Jones makes us uncomfortable witnesses, denying us the luxury of looking away.</p>
<p>Life as a vampire is no easy task. Good Stab suffers all manner of injury and oscillates between starvation and gluttony. He also endures psychological torment. Like the Cat Man, he slowly becomes the thing he feeds on, presenting him with an impossible choice: consume the very people he hopes to avenge or become the thing he hates most.</p>
<p>Jones, a member of the Blackfeet Nation, isn&rsquo;t spinning a supernatural revenge fantasy. Through Good Stab&rsquo;s transformation, he explores how violence changes the avenger. The feeding metaphor captures how trauma can perpetuate itself across generations, with victims adopting the behaviours they once suffered under.</p>
<p>Some might find Arthur&rsquo;s archaic language and Good Stab&rsquo;s Blackfeet terminology difficult to parse. But these linguistic layers add authenticity and emotional weight to the story.</p>
<p>Arthur, in particular, is utterly charming. His penchant for good food and affection for the cat he rescues from a house of ill repute make him likeable. It&rsquo;s all the more shocking, then, when he is revealed to be something of a monster himself. As he says, he &ldquo;can be convincing when allowed to paint with words.&rdquo; In this meta-commentary, Jones challenges us to question the narrative frame we&rsquo;re reading—whose stories get preserved, who interprets them, and how appealing prose can disguise monstrous realities.</p>
<p>While The Buffalo Hunter Hunter may test readers' endurance with its violence, Jones has created something unprecedented: a vampire narrative that uses horror conventions to expose America&rsquo;s refusal to confront its bloody foundations. It&rsquo;s not just a timely book—it&rsquo;s a necessary one, suggesting that some historical debts can never be paid, only acknowledged. In Jones&rsquo;s American gothic, the real horror isn&rsquo;t the monster but the country that created it.</p>
